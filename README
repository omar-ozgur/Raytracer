*** Project 3 README ***

After adding the necessary code, all test images appeared to be created correctly. The output files
"testAmbient.ppm", "testBackground.ppm", "testBehind.ppm", "testDiffuse.ppm", "testIllum.ppm", 
"testIntersection.ppm", "testParsing.ppm", "testReflection.ppm", "testSample.ppm", "testShadow.ppm",
and "testSpecular.ppm" compiled correctly, and looked nearly identical to the provided sample images.

The code can be compiled with the command "g++ raytrace.cpp -o raytrace", or by importing the files
into an IDE such as XCode.
